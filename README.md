# Calculatrice

> A Vue.js project

SUBJECT

Please implement the following tasks as a console application in your favorite programming or
scripting language.
Please note that you must output a graph for part 3, which is based on part 1. You can convert your
console application into a graphical application, such as a JavaScript program with an HTML5 canvas,
but you can also output this graph as console text in the size 80x24.
Tasks

Part 1 Develop a term calculator that can handle (), *, /, +, and -. For example, if the user enters the
term (5 + 8) * 3/8 +3, the term calculator shall calculate and output the result according to the school
rules of term calculations.
These rules are: () before * and /, * and / before + and -. Several * and / are calculated from left to
right, several + and - also from left to right.
Important: The actual algorithm must be implemented itself. The use of functions like eval in
JavaScript are not permitted.

Part 2 Peter likes numbers. As a meditation exercise, he likes to write down all the numbers starting
with 1 whose digits are sorted in ascending order. For example, 11235888 is such a number. After a
while, he stops.
Write an efficiently designed program which, after entering a number between 1 and 10 ^ 18,
represents the last number checked by Peter, outputs the last number written down by Peter.
Examples:
Input: 23245 Output: 22999
Input: 11235888 Output: 11235888
Input: 111110 Output: 99999
Input: 33245 Output: 29999
Tip: Going through the numbers one by one and testing them is not efficient enough.

Part 3, based on Part 1 Allow the term calculator to accept lines in the form y = <TERM> with x as an
additional possible character in the term. If such a complete equation is given, you display a simple x /
y graph. For each value on the x axis, calculate y and plot the point (a continuous line is even better).
